group of 3 to use the skills learned during the course to produce a report and deliver a presentation on a data set relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. We chose to compare the daily new deaths of Germany and Poland since they share a boarder and had contrasting governance approaches to the pandemic. <mark className=\"highlight\"><b>We scored 90% on this project.</b></mark> I was very proud of this because the project was supposed to be done in groups of 4, however I was assigned to a group of 3 - with 2 people that spoke English as their second language. I learnt some great communication skills as a result. All analysis in this project was conducted using R.</p>\r\n\r\n<ReactMarkdown \r\nclassName='ReactMarkdown'\r\nchildren={`## Abstract`}\r\nremarkPlugins={[remarkMath]}\r\nrehypePlugins={[rehypeKatex]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ReactMarkdown \r\nclassName='ReactMarkdown'\r\nchildren={`In this report we analysed Polish and German daily new deaths, recorded from March, 2020 to January, 2021, by considering $$(\\\\mathbf{SARIMA}$$) models using an iterative Box-Jenkins approach.

Upon our initial plots (Fig. 1), it is evident that the raw data does not meet this condition since the mean is not constant, whilst the variance and covariance differ across time.
