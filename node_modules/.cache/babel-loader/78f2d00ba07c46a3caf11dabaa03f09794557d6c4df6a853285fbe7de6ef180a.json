Upon our initial plots (Fig. 1), it is evident that the raw data does not meet this condition since the mean is not constant, whilst the variance and covariance differ across time. This observation is reaffirmed by an Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) on the raw data, which yields  p-values of 0.9286 and 0.99, for Poland and Germany respectively. `}\r\nremarkPlugins={[remarkMath]}\r\nrehypePlugins={[rehypeKatex]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src={Figure1}/>\r\n<figcaption className=\"figurecaption\" align = \"center\"><b>Figure 1 : Poland's (Red) and Germany's (Blue) new daily deaths.</b></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<ReactMarkdown \r\nclassName='ReactMarkdown'\r\nchildren={`With the stationary data, we then examine the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for each time series.
