By January 30th 2020, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1] and by March 2020 a Global Pandemic had been established [2]. As the pandemic evolved, the epicentre shifted from the Hubei Province to Central Europe and, as of January 31st 2020, Europe’s 5 largest countries are all in the World’s top 10 for most COVID-19 cases - meanwhile China sits 83rd [3]. With that in mind, the European data is important to understanding the nature of the pandemic and how it might progress. \n                      \n                      Throughout the course of history, humans have experienced the deadliest plagues, infectious diseases and epidemics, which have wiped out millions of people. Every outbreak has long-lasting effects on society and causes great suffering on humankind. However, through mathematical modelling we can learn from the past to advance our understanding of epidemiology, push medical innovation and reduce casualties.\n                      \n                      Since the beginning of the outbreak, many mathematical and computational models have been published to analyse and predict the coronavirus case and death figures. These models are fundamental to government decision makers attempting to minimise the number of deaths and strain on health services, whilst ensuring the economy can function as best as possible. At the start of the pandemic, Zeynep Ceylan [4] modelled COVID-19 case figures in Spain, Italy and the UK using ARIMA models with second order differencing to help epidemiologists assess the worst affected areas. Meanwhile other models focused on forecasting the spread and death rate of coronavirus [5].`,\n          remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],\n          rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex]\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 44,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 22,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 20,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Footer, {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 67,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(ScrollUp, {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 68,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true);\n};\n_c = ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks;\nexport default ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","Header","Footer","ScrollUp","ReactMarkdown","remarkMath","rehypeKatex","ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks"],"sources":["D:/Ethan_Webb_Personal_Website/ethan-website/src/components/projectpages/ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\r\nimport \"../../App.css\";\r\nimport Header from '../header/Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../footer/Footer';\r\nimport ScrollUp from '../scrollup/ScrollUp';\r\nimport \"./projectpage.css\"\r\n\r\nimport ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'\r\nimport remarkMath from 'remark-math'\r\nimport rehypeKatex from 'rehype-katex'\r\n\r\nimport 'katex/dist/katex.min.css' // `rehype-katex` does not import the CSS for you\r\n\r\n\r\nconst ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n      <>\r\n      <Header />\r\n    \r\n        <div className='container'>\r\n\r\n            <section className=\"projectpage__section\">\r\n                    <h2 className=\"projectpage__title\">Article Title</h2>\r\n                    <span className=\"projectpage__subtitle\">This is the subtitle of the article.</span>\r\n                    <span className=\"projectpage__stats\">\r\n\r\n                    <i class=\"uil uil-calender projectpage__icon\"></i>\r\n                    <p>Published on January 17, 2022</p>\r\n                    <p class=\"projectpage__bullet\">•</p>\r\n\r\n                    <i class=\"uil uil-clock projectpage__icon\"></i>\r\n                    <p>14 minutes</p>\r\n                    <p class=\"projectpage__bullet\">•</p>\r\n\r\n                    <i class=\"uil uil-book-open projectpage__icon\"></i>\r\n                    <p>2925 words</p>\r\n\r\n                    </span>\r\n\r\n                    <div className='headline__image cnn__image'></div>\r\n\r\n                    <p className='project__textblock'><b>Context:</b> Part of my Statistical Learning Module, I was placed in a group of 4 challenged with writing a report (and delivering a presentation at a class conference) based on Convolution Neural Networks.
